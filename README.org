* NOTE
This copy is far behind the latest msmtp and I won't update it anymore. 
I used to have a single generic password for my email in macOS Keychain, which
required this change. However, msmtp has a built-in mechanism to look for the
SMTP password in the Keychain for the given host and user.
So I now simply maintain two entries, even if it means a little more effort when
they change:
#+begin_src
> security add-internet-password -r smtp -s <host> -a <user> -w
(prompts for password)
> security add-internet-password -r imap -s <host> -a <user> -w
(prompts for password)
#+end_src

*I strongly recommend using that approach and using the latest msmtp instead of this patch.*
